# Library Management System

This is an Asp.NET Core MVC project.<br>
I used Microsoft SQL Server in this project for database.

## Images from project:

<p>You can list all books and do search on books without login.</p>

<p>But if you want to do book request then you should log in.</p>

<p>If you have an admin account then you can reach Author page. Here you can add new author or edit on exist author and delete them.</p>

<p>Same way if you are an admin you can add new books, edit and delete them.</p>

<p>If you are an admin you can add new user or new admin but if you don't an admin then you can't add a new admin. This feature is only for admin.</p>
